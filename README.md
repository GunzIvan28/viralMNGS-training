## **Introduction**

UVRI and MRC-University of Glasgow Center for Virus Research have organised a one day joint bioinformatics training happening on 26th Feb 2019. The training will focus on genome assemblies and taxonomic profiling from NGS data. A quick intro to linux will be offered as well.
The training is aimed at graduate students and other researchers. You don't need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the training.
UVRI E-Library, Plot 51-59, Nakiwogo Road Entebbe on Feb 26, 2019. Participants owning laptops can bring them along.
They do not need to have specific software packages installed since we sahll be using the UVRI server.
