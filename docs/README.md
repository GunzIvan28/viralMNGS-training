## **Getting onto the server**
Each of the users has been assigned login details which includes a username and password. To log onto the uvri server, we use ssh (secure shell) as shown in the command below.

```
ssh username@galaxy.uvri.go.ug
```
Notes:
* `username`: Assigned user name for example `student1`
* `galaxy.uvri.go.ug`: name of the server that we are using for this training.

You will be prompted to enter your passowrd and once that is done, you will be logged onto the server and ready to start working.
